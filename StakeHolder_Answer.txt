The product manager should create simple instructions on how to upload csv onto microsoft excel. Moreover, the instructions should include
useful tricks on how to filter desired rows and columns, find the sum of a column, and other relevant tricks that stakeholder might need such as creating graphs.
Lastly, I would suggest that the product manager mention to the stakeholder if there are 'missing' instructions they can find those answers on youtube.
